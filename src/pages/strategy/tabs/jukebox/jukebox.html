	<div class="help_q">What is this page for?</div>
	<div class="help_a">This page serves as a free game BGM player.
	Music information taken from in-game API data, so only those tracks currently used by game are listed here,
	in track ID order for port section, map ID order for battle section.<br/>
	For more music information, see this <a href="https://en.kancollewiki.net/Music" target="_blank">EN wiki page</a>
	or this <a href="https://wikiwiki.jp/kancolle/BGM" target="_blank">JP wiki page</a>.</div>

	<div class="help_q">Is it safe that connect to game sever for playing BGM outside of game play?</div>
	<div class="help_a">Yes, as long as your browser cache works properly.
	Anyway, it's recommanded to use a 3rd party cache utility, like KCCP, to reduce network traffic as possible.</div>

	<div class="help_q">Why are some tracks duplicated?</div>
	<div class="help_a">Because they are used by game duplicatedly.
	For port section, tracks with ID starting from 200 are used by in-game jukebox furniture, so all of them have title.
	For battle section, tracks are assigned to various sortie scenes and updated seasonally and duplicatedly.</div>
